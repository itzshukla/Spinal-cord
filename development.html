<h1 align="center"><font color="red">Spinal Cord Development</h1></font>
<p align="center"><b>The spinal cord is made from part of the neural tube during development. There are four stages of the spinal cord that arises from the neural tube: The neural plate, neural fold, neural tube, and the spinal cord. Neural differentiation occurs within the spinal cord portion of the tube.<br> As the neural tube begins to develop, the notochord begins to secrete a factor known as Sonic hedgehog (SHH). The alar plate and the basal plate are separated by the sulcus limitans. Additionally, the floor plate also secretes netrins. <br>The netrins act as chemoattractants to decussation of pain and temperature sensory neurons in the alar plate across the anterior white commissure, where they then ascend towards the thalamus. Following the closure of the caudal neuropore and formation of the brain's ventricles that contain the choroid plexus tissue, the central canal of the caudal spinal cord is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.<br><br>
Earlier findings by Viktor Hamburger and Rita Levi-Montalcini in the chick embryo have been confirmed by more recent studies which have demonstrated that the elimination of neuronal cells by programmed cell death is necessary for the correct assembly of the nervous system.<br><br>
Overall, spontaneous embryonic activity has been shown to play a role in neuron and muscle development but is probably not involved in the initial formation of connections between spinal neurons.</b></p>
